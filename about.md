Hello there! I'm Sławomir Radzymiński, a test engineer based in the beautiful city of Kraków.

As a dedicated and passionate test engineer, I have consistently championed test automation and Continuous
Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) processes throughout my career. I strongly believe in adopting modern software
development techniques that ensure rapid delivery of high-quality products to clients. Currently, I hold the position of
Senior Staff Test Engineer at Ocado Technology, where I continue to pursue my passion for test engineering and new
technologies. Beyond my professional commitments, I also actively engage as a trainer, collaborating with various
training companies and universities to share my knowledge and expertise.

On a personal note, I am blessed with a beautiful wife and amazing children who bring joy and meaning to my life. In my
free time, I relish the opportunity to play squash, travel to new places, and challenge my mind with scrabble. To stay
fit and healthy, I make it a point to regularly hit the gym. I also enjoy unwinding by watching TV series with my wife,
as it allows us to bond and relax together. Through a well-balanced blend of professional dedication and personal
interests, I strive to lead a fulfilling life and contribute positively to the world of software engineering.
