      Hello there! I'm Sławomir Radzymiński, a test engineer based in the
      beautiful city of Kraków.

    <p>
      I'm a seasoned test engineer who's always embraced test automation and
      CI/CD to help teams deliver high-quality software at speed. As a Senior
      Staff Test Engineer at Ocado Technology, I stay on the cutting edge of
      modern development practices, sharing my knowledge and expertise both at
      work and as a trainer with various companies and universities.
    </p>

    <p>
      When I'm not immersed in code and pipelines, you'll find me enjoying time
      with my wonderful family, hitting the squash court, exploring new travel
      destinations, or challenging myself at scrabble. I keep fit with regular
      gym sessions and wind down by watching TV series with my wife, making sure
      I strike a balance between professional growth and personal fulfillment.
