Unlock the full potential of performance testing with our comprehensive training course that explores the ins and outs
of Gatling, a powerful and efficient performance testing tool. This course is designed to guide you through the
essential concepts and practical applications of performance testing, ensuring you have the knowledge and skills needed
to excel in this critical area of software testing.

The course begins with an introduction to software performance, covering the fundamentals of performance tests, various
types of testing, associated risks, and key metrics. You'll learn how to design and set up performance tests, as well as
effectively analyze results using statistical tools.

Next, you'll dive into the application setup, learning how to start a project, understand the architecture of the tested
system, and run the project and tests simultaneously. You'll then explore the process of writing performance tests using
Gatling and JavaScript, focusing on practical techniques such as refactoring scripts, managing test data, generating
random data, reusing values from HTTP responses, and more.

Finally, the course concludes with an exploration of advanced topics, including performance requirements definition,
functional and non-functional assertions, the role of load balancers in performance testing, and working with SLIs,
SLAs, and SLOs. By mastering these concepts, you'll be well-equipped to establish clear performance metrics and
effectively report to business and management stakeholders.

Don't miss this opportunity to enhance your skillset and become a highly proficient performance tester with our Gatling
Performance Testing Training. Enroll today and take the first step towards transforming your software testing career.
