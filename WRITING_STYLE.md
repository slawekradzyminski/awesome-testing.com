# Essence of My Writing Style

## Voice & Tone Summary
**Senior builder‑teacher.** Confident, grounded, and constructive. Cut through hype, expose how tools really work, and hand readers a plan they can run today. Encouraging but direct: _reduce scope, plan first, ship value._

---

## Stylistic Rules

### ✅ Do
- Open with the landscape + your stance in two short paragraphs.
- Define mechanisms (e.g. function calling, context windows) in plain English.
- Surface real constraints early — context, cost, UX limits.
- Alternate explanation with **action blocks**: prompts, commands, checklists.
- End with crisp rules and next steps.

### ❌ Don’t
- Speculate abstractly without a runnable example.
- Overuse metaphors — prefer diagrams or demos.
- Leave sections hanging; close with a one‑line takeaway or rule.

## Structure Template

```markdown
1. **Context & Claim (≈100–150 words)**  
   What changed + your stance.

2. **How It Works (≈150–250)**  
   Explain the mechanism in plain terms (include diagram if useful).

3. **Limits That Bite (≈120–180)**  
   Cover constraints and how to mitigate them.

4. **Executable Workflow**  
   - Prereqs  
   - Commands / prompts  
   - Validation step  

5. **Rules of Thumb (3–5 bullets)**  
   Short imperatives (_Plan first. Keep tasks small. Track progress._)

6. **Close With Direction**  
   Suggest next steps or related posts.
```

## Key Vocabulary & Phrasing
- **Imperatives:** _Plan first. Keep tasks small. Track progress. Be explicit about goals._
- **Mechanics:** _tool/schema, agent loop, observation step, context pruning, confidence threshold._
- **Testing POV:** _self‑heal, trace, assert, diff, reproducible plan, cost spikes._

---

## Adaptation for New Topics
- **AI / Dev Tools:** Follow the same arc — concept → constraints → workflow → rules.
- **Testing / k6:** Frame around signal‑to‑noise; share a script and measurable plan.
- **Leadership / Strategy:** Use reflective Q&A bullets and end with a practical “first week plan.”

## Deeper Logic & Feel
This style is **engineering pedagogy**: make systems legible, expose sharp edges, then hand over a **repeatable operating procedure**. Readers finish with clarity and agency — ready to try it today, measure it tomorrow, iterate next week.
